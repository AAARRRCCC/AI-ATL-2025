## Critical Tasks 🔴

**Must work to demonstrate the product - focus here first!**

### 🔴-1: Complete Backend Function Executor

**Priority**: CRITICAL (Demo Blocker)
**Impact**: AI can't create assignments or schedule tasks - the core feature doesn't work!
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Location**: `backend/services/function_executor.py`

**Why Critical for Demo**: Judges need to see the AI actually creating assignments and scheduling them to calendars. This is the main value proposition.

**Tasks**:

#### 1a. Implement `create_assignment` function
- [ ] Parse function arguments from Gemini
- [ ] Insert assignment into MongoDB `assignments` collection
- [ ] Return assignment ID to AI
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

**Implementation**:
```python
async def _create_assignment(self, args: dict):
    assignment = {
        "userId": ObjectId(self.user_id),
        "title": args["assignment_title"],
        "type": args["assignment_type"],
        "dueDate": datetime.fromisoformat(args["due_date"]),
        "subject": args.get("subject", "general"),
        "estimatedHours": args.get("estimated_hours", 5),
        "status": "active",
        "createdAt": datetime.utcnow(),
        "phases": []
    }
    result = await self.db.assignments.insert_one(assignment)
    return {"assignmentId": str(result.inserted_id), "status": "created"}
```

#### 1b. Implement `break_down_assignment` function
- [ ] Parse phases and tasks from AI
- [ ] Insert tasks into MongoDB `tasks` collection
- [ ] Link tasks to assignment
- [ ] Calculate time estimates per phase
- [ ] Return task IDs

#### 1c. Implement `schedule_tasks` function
- [ ] Get free time blocks from calendar API
- [ ] Match tasks to free blocks based on preferences
- [ ] Create Google Calendar events for each task
- [ ] Store calendar event IDs with tasks
- [ ] Return scheduled task count

**Demo Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Maximum - nothing works without this)

## Development Tips

### For Local Demo

**DON'T worry about**:
- ❌ WebSocket authentication (trust yourself)
- ❌ Rate limiting (no abuse locally)
- ❌ Input sanitization (you control the inputs)
- ❌ Production deployment
- ❌ Testing (demo first, test later)

**DO focus on**:
- ✅ Features working end-to-end
- ✅ Visual polish and animations
- ✅ Impressive demo data
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ Quick setup/reset

### Debug Mode is Good!

Keep those console.log statements in `lib/google-calendar.ts` - they help you debug issues during demo prep!

### Quick Reset

Create a reset script to clear all data and re-seed:
```bash
npm run reset-demo  # Clear DB + Reseed
```

---

## Notes

- **Demo Mode**: This is optimized for local hackathon presentation
- **Security**: Intentionally simplified - address in "future work" section if asked
- **Time Estimates**: Single developer, focused work
- **Current Progress**: ~60% complete
- **To Demo-Ready**: ~40% remaining (12-16 hours)

**Focus**: Make it work, make it impressive, win the hackathon! 🏆

---

## How to Use This TODO

1. **Start with 🔴 CRITICAL** - Get core demo working
2. **Move to 🟠 HIGH** - Add impressive features
3. **Cherry-pick 🟡 MEDIUM** - Based on time
4. **Ignore 🟢 LOW** - Post-hackathon concerns

**For AI Assistants**: This is a DEMO-FOCUSED repo. Prioritize features and UX over security and testing. The user wants an impressive presentation, not production-ready code.

**Security Note**: This project is for local demonstration only. Security hardening moved to post-hackathon roadmap.
